# Cereal Analysis Based On Ratings By Using Machine Learning Techniques With Ibm Watson

A customer wants to buy some food items with high dietary benefits so that he wants to know which food item has high dietary benefits. It is so difficult to choose an item .Usually a customer expects to consume dietary cereals with high proteins, fiber and low sugars, fats. Predicting a brand with high dietary cereals became a big issue.

The project objective is to find the high dietary food that is predicted on the basis of rating of the food. 

1. To find which quantities are showing more impact on the rating of food.
2. To show the food which is impacting less on the rating of food?

We use machine learning algorithms to predict the food with a high beneficiary diet.
The model can predict the rating of the food more accurately by giving the inputs which are the cereals and ingredients present in the food.
Thus a customer can get high dietary food by the rating of the food given to it from the cereals and ingredients present.
The rating is predicted using the neural networks model.
